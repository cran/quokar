\title{Q-function distance for each observation in quantile regression model}
\usage{
ALDqr_QD(y, x, tau, error, iter)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Dependent variable in quantile regression. Note that: we suppose
y follows asymmetric laplace distribution.}

\item{x}{Indepdent variables in quantile regression.
Note that: x is the independent variable matrix which including
the intercept. That means, if the dimension of independent
variables is p and the sample size is n, x is a n times p+1
matrix with the first column is one.}

\item{tau}{Quantile}

\item{error}{The EM algorithm accuracy of error used in MLE estimation}

\item{iter}{The iteration frequancy for EM algorithm used in MLE estimation}
}
\description{
Q-function distance for each observation in quantile regression model
}
\details{
Measure of the influence of the \eqn{i}th case is the following Q-distance
function, similar to the likelihood distance \eqn{LD_{i}} (Cook and Weisberg, 1982),
defined as

\deqn{QD_{i} = 2{Q(\hat{\theta}|\hat{\theta})-Q(\hat{\theta_{(i)}})}}
