\title{Calculate the case-deletion coefficience of the MLE estimation of
quantile regression}
\usage{
ALDqr_case_deletion(y, x, tau, error, iter)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Response variable in quantile regression model}

\item{x}{Predictors in quantile regression model.
Note that: x is the independent variable matrix which including
the intercept. That means, if the dimension of independent
variables is p and the sample size is n, x is a n times p+1
matrix with the first column being one.}

\item{tau}{Quantile}

\item{error}{The EM algorithm accuracy of error used in MLE estimation}

\item{iter}{The iteration frequancy for EM algorithm used in MLE
estimation}
}
